                 So, here are the best book review sites to
                  help you avoid buying books that you'll

                It’s impossible not to mention Goodreads when discussing book communities: it’s the Facebook of book reviews — the ultimate social media platform for bibliophiles. If you’ve somehow managed to go this long without stumbling upon this omnipresent site, here’s the run-down: you can use Goodreads to organize, display, and discuss your virtual bookshelf with other users. 

Goodreads recommendations are based on your listed interests. 

Also if you like to browse lists, Goodreads compiles the best and most popular books for every genre. There’s also the annual Goodreads’ Choice Awards to celebrate each year’s new releases, where you can cast your vote or peruse the list of contenders to find a new book to read. It’s a site for every kind of reader, with abundant ways to comment and interact. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">

                Avid readers, you’ve probably stumbled upon Book Riot more times than you can remember. While it’s not a site that individually assesses titles, it has lists for everything — from timeless literary giants to the top books in each genre. What’s more, Book Riot has lots of thinkpieces that dive deep into the way certain titles make readers feel — be it exhilarated, motivated, or enraged — and that’s really all you need to know when deciding to embark on a new reading adventure. 

Additionally, if you’d rather listen to discussions and reviews rather than read them, you'll be happy to know that Book Riot has a range of podcasts for you to choose from. <a href="https://bookriot.com/read">

                NetGalley is another platform bringing you new and
                 unconventional recommendations. They specialize in connecting authors
                  who are publishing to readers who’d like to preview and put in their two cents. 
                  While the database of books available here are not the most expansive, those that are featured are certainly worth your time. 
                Readers can benefit most from NetGalley via their book recommendation site, Bookish, where the staff reviewers update you
                 with their recent reads and in-depth thoughts on those reads. Along with that, Bookish also has book club kits, equipped with 
                 comprehension questions and discussion points, to help readers explore stories mindfully.<a href="https://www.netgalley.com/">

                This is the OG of all online book catalogues and discussion boards — take a look and you’ll see that it’s an oldie but a goodie. Of course, the basic functions of LibraryThing are rather similar to Goodreads: there are millions of books that readers can add to their lists, as well as review with star ratings.

While the interface harks back to the earlier days of the world wide web, LibraryThing has a secret weapon that’ll appeal to all readers, especially modern ones: their Zeitgeist. This page displays the latest crème de la crème of the whole site, from the most popular books to the hottest reviews, which you can also write with the help of a good book review template. Just a glance shows that the readers here know how to read between the lines and wield their words!<a href="https://www.librarything.com/">

                Though it’s UK-based, this prolific site caters to audiences around the world. LoveReading is strictly a reviewing site, with a base of staff writers and carefully selected contributors, so you know the reviews are top-notch. The staff often give quite personal reading experiences in their reviews, which make their recommendations very endearing, like they’re from a close friend. They even offer you presents — well, if you think of giveaways as presents! 

LoveReading covers books from every genre you can think of. They also have weekly, monthly, and yearly list features to keep you up to date with the latest stellar releases, so you’ll never be in want of something to pore over.  <a href="https://www.lovereading.co.uk/">
